Write out pseudo-cod (both casual and formal) that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
START
SET num1 = 5
SET num2 = 4
PRINT num1 + num 2
END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
START
SET arr = [array of strings]
SET result = ""
WHILE iterator < length of arr
  result = result + value of arr at space 'iterator'

PRINT result
END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
START
SET num_arr = [array of numbers]
SET new_arr = []
while iterator < length of num_arr
  if iterator is even
    next
  else
    new_arr.append(value of num_arr at 'iterator')

PRINT new_arr
END
