# frozen_string_literal: true

# The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms:

# Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

# They call themselves at least once.
# They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
# They use the result returned by themselves.
# In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing; and, n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the recursive call to compute a new return value.

# Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.
