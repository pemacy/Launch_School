# frozen_string_literal: true

# A triangle is classified as follows:

# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides
# must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have
# lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the
# triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as
# arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or
# :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene,
# or invalid.

def triangle(*sides)
  sides = sides.sort
  return :invalid if sides.include? 0
  return :invalid if sides[0..1].reduce(&:+) <= sides.last
  return :equilateral if sides.uniq.size == 1
  return :isosceles if sides.uniq.size == 2

  :scalene
end

p triangle(3, 3, 3) == :equilateral
p triangle(3, 3, 1.5) == :isosceles
p triangle(3, 4, 5) == :scalene
p triangle(0, 3, 3) == :invalid
p triangle(3, 1, 1) == :invalid
