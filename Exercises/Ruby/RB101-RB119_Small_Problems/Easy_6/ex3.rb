# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...)
# such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number
# is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the
# natural world.

# Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results
# grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is
# 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it
# takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.

# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci
# number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first
# Fibonacci number has index 1.)
